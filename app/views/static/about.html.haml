					Dr. Twamley earned a PhD in Clinical Psychology from Arizona State University and completed 
					her clinical psychology internship and postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San 
					Diego (UCSD), and the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS). She joined the faculty of 
					the UCSD Department of Psychiatry in 2003, where she does research, teaching, and clinical 
					work. She is also Chief of the Neuropsychology Unit of the Center of Excellence for Stress and 
					Mental Health (CESAMH) at the VASDHS. 
				%p
					Dr. Twamley's research focuses on bridging neuropsychology and interventions for individuals 
					with cognitive impairments. Pursuing a longstanding interest in the links between cognition 
					and everyday functioning, she has developed compensatory cognitive training interventions for 
					people with psychiatric illness, traumatic brain injury, and mild cognitive impairment, and these 
					manuals have been adapted for other populations (e.g., autism, Parkinson’s disease, multiple 
					sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, HIV, and hoarding). Current intervention studies focus 
					on compensatory cognitive training and supported employment for individuals with cognitive 
					and psychiatric symptoms. Dr. Twamley’s research has been funded by the National Institute 
					of Mental Health, the VA, the Department of Defense, and the Brain and Behavior Research 
					Foundation.
				%p
					Dr. Twamley is a licensed clinical psychologist specializing in neuropsychological assessment, 
					cognitive rehabilitation, and supported employment. She is particularly interested in community-
					based interventions that help people reach their highest potential social and occupational 
					functioning, and directs the UCSD Supported Employment Program, which has helped 
					hundreds of people with psychiatric illness return to the workforce. She supervises psychology 
					interns, doctoral students, and undergraduate students at UCSD and VASDHS. She also
					conducts a neuropsychological assessment clinic at the St. Vincent De Paul Medical Clinic.
